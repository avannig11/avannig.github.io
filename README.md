## Data Scientist
**Faurecia, Bangalore, India**  
June 2020 - June 2022  
- **Machine Learning & Automation:** Implemented ML and DL models for R&D projects, improving efficiency by 30%.
- **Web Development & Project Optimization:** Developed web apps using Flask & Bootstrap; integrated spatial data techniques for optimizing routes, resulting in 5% cost savings and 30% productivity increase.
- **Full Stack System Development:** Created a Mixer full stack system, reducing simulation process from months to 15 seconds with 93% accuracy.
- **Awards & Recognition:** Received 'Spot Award', 'Customer Appreciation Award', and 'We the Team Award' for outstanding contributions.

### Projects
- **Mixer (2020):** Developed a Continuous Learning Pipeline for Machine Learning models like xGBoost, GBRTrees and Deep Learning Neural Net models to predict mixer performance variables with respect to new data that continuously keeps getting added with time. This stable model has optimized the simulation process which took 3-4 months to 15 seconds with an accuracy of 93%. Optimization of Design Variables using Genetic Algorithm and Pulp package of python is also developed under the guidance of the Fluid Dynamics Team.
  
- **Footprint Optimization (2020-2021):** Developed a UI using Flask with Bootstrap forms which takes different parameters as input and optimizes the Footprint, Cost, and Inventory outputs between various plants. Benchmark footprint for a specific customer plant is also calculated with considering the lowest cost parameters. Google API calls are made to find the shortest distance between any two plants so that accurate costs can be calculated.
  
- **Measurement (2021-2022):**  Developed a UI using Flask for the shopfloor and strategy team where the deviated manufactured parts are highlighted. An Email service is also triggered when a greater number of parts are manufactured with highest deviation. SQLite Database is used with continuous updating of parts information.
  
## Project Assistant
**Society for Innovation and Development, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India**  
June 2018 - June 2020  
- Contributed to the development of Faurecia's FiDeS, resulting in a 45% reduction in time and costs.

### Project
- **Fides (2018-2020):** Built an Automated Rule-based system that processes CAD models of a cocoon and finds the best fit silencer with respect to the design rules of the exhaust system of a car using various technologies like Mongo DB, Ontology, Ray-tracing method, Rhino-Python, Catia, Machine Learning models like SVM. Achieved an 80% reduction in time and costs in developing a best fit silencer to the specific model of the car.
