### ACADEMIC PROJECTS
▪ Classification Between AI-Generated and Traditional Music 
Fall 2023 
Course: CIS 731- Artificial Neural Networks
  • Data Collection: Collected data from over 10 free websites, creating a comprehensive dataset for nuanced analysis.
  • Project Objective: Devised a classifier differentiating AI-generated and traditional music, employing spectrograms for CNN and MFCCs for ANN, covering 400 audio samples.
  • Results: Enhanced audio pattern recognition accuracy by 30% using CNN with spectrograms, surpassing MFCC- based ANN methods.
  
▪ Computational Clustering of Media Biases 
Spring 2023 
Course : CIS 668 - Natural Language Processing
  • Data Source: Extracted news media data from Media Cloud for analysis, processing over 27069 articles from multiple sources in a consortium research project.
  • Methodology: Employed an unsupervised approach to compute biases in news coverage and clustered news sources into three groups using NLP techniques such as lemmatization, TF-IDF,UMAP, HDBScan.
  • Results: Identified news sources with similar coverage or framing over an 8-month timeline.
  
▪ Reddit Sentiment Analysis to Forecast Cryptocurrency Market Behavior 
Spring 2023 
Course: CIS 600 - Social Media Data Mining
  • Data Collection: Utilized Reddit API to aggregate data from 11504 cryptocurrency threads, amassing a substantial dataset for in-depth analysis.
  • Analysis Technique: Implemented Sentiment Analysis and Xgboost algorithms on a dataset encompassing over 2000 Reddit posts, accurately forecasting Ethereum market trends.
  • Findings: Study suggests that Reddit data can predict next-day volatilities and 7-day returns for cryptocurrencies, highlighting the mixed effectiveness of sentiment variables in forecasting.
