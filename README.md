### Data Scientist
Faurecia, Bangalore, India
June 2020 - June 2022 
  
  • Machine Learning & Automation: Implemented ML and DL models like Genetic Algorithm, SVM, Neural Networks for
  R&D projects, securing significant time , cost, and elevating efficiency by 30% through strategic automation.
  • Web Development & Project Optimization: Developed internal web apps using Flask & Bootstrap enhancing Shopfloor
  and Strategy operations, incorporating spatial data techniques using Google API for calculating the shortest routes
  between factories, realizing 5% cost savings and 30% productivity increase.
  • Full Stack System Development: Developed a Mixer full stack system, optimizing the simulation process from months to
  15 seconds with 93% accuracy.
  • Awards & Recognition: Recognized with the 'Spot Award' for pioneering efficient ML models, the 'Customer Appreciation Award' for delivering high-impact automation solutions, and the 'We the Team Award' for collaborative success in project optimizations.
  
#### Project
Mixer [2020]: Developed a Continuous Learning Pipeline for Machine Learning models like xGBoost, GBRTrees and Deep Learning Neural Net models to predict mixer performance variables with respect to new data that continuously keeps getting added with time. This stable model has optimized the simulation process which took 3-4 months to 15 seconds with an accuracy of 93%. Optimization of Design Variables using Genetic Algorithm and Pulp package of python is also developed under the guidance of the Fluid Dynamics Team.

Footprint Optimization [2020-2021]: Developed a UI using Flask with Bootstrap forms which takes different parameters as input and optimizes the Footprint, Cost, and Inventory outputs between various plants. Benchmark footprint for a specific customer plant is also calculated with considering the lowest cost parameters. Google API calls are made to find the shortest distance between any two plants so that accurate costs can be calculated.

Measurement [2021-2022]: Developed a UI using Flask for the shopfloor and strategy team where the deviated manufactured parts are highlighted. An Email service is also triggered when a greater number of parts are manufactured with highest deviation. SQLite Database is used with continuous updating of parts information.

### Project Assistant
Society for Innovation and Development, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India
June 2018 - June 2020 
• Research & Development: Contributed to the development of Faurecia's FiDeS at the Centre for Product Development and Manufacturing under Prof Gurumurthy, resulting in a 45% reduction in time and costs.

#### Project
Fides [2018-2020]: Built an Automated Rule-based system that processes CAD models of a cocoon and finds the best fit silencer with respect to the design rules of the exhaust system of a car using various technologies like Mongo DB, Ontology, Ray-tracing method, Rhino-Python, Catia, Machine Learning models like SVM. Achieved an 80% reduction in time and costs in developing a best fit silencer to the specific model of the car.
